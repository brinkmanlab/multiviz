# Intergenome visualization plugin for Galaxy

This plugin is intended to visualize the output generated by the [IslandCompare](http://github.com/brinkmanlab/islandcompare) workflow.

## Installation

- Clone this repo into the configured Galaxy visualizations plugin folder (`galaxy_root/config/plugins/visualizations/` by default).
- Currently, the newly created folder must be named `islandcompare` for the IslandCompare front-end to find it. This should change in the future.
- Restart Galaxy.

## Galaxy automated deployment

If using the terraform recipes to deploy Galaxy, the module provides a means to automatically install visualizations. Host a url pointing at a location of the zipped "islandcompare" folder containing the built visualization. Pass it to the [visualizations](https://github.com/brinkmanlab/galaxy-container/tree/master/destinations/aws#input_visualizations) parameter of the Galaxy module. Currently the zip files are hosted in the "Releases" section of this repository.

## Notes

To inject input.b64: `sed -e '/<section id="injected_data" hidden="">/r ./input.b64'`
